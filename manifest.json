          "description": "Final Fantasy II features gameplay similar to that of its predecessor, Final Fantasy. The player can freely roam an overworld containing several towns and dungeons. A menu-based system allows the player to outfit each character with equipment and up to twooften disposableitems for battle. Magic spells are assigned to the character from the item menu, and certain spells, such as \"Cure\", can be used outside of battle. The player can also save their progress on the overworld. Weapons, armor, items, and magic spells can be purchased at shops, and townspeople provide useful information for the player's progression through the game. One new feature is the \"Word Memory\" system: when in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), the player can \"ask\" about and \"memorize\" special keywords or phrases, which can later be repeated to other NPCs to gain more information or unlock new actions. Similarly, there exist a handful of special items that can be shown to NPCs during conversation or used on certain objects, which have the same effect. Characters and monsters are no longer separated into separate windows in the battle screen as they were in Final Fantasy I, and players can see their current and total hit points below the battle. Players can also fight with less than four characters in their party, which was not possible in the first game. Final Fantasy II introduced the chocobo, the signature Final Fantasy mascot, which lets characters ride to a location at great speed without being attacked by enemies. The recurring character Cid was also introduced in II; a character of the same name has appeared in every main-series game since.\n\nOn the overworld and within dungeons, (that image was banned because it came from a ROM site) random encounters with enemies can be fought to improve each character's attributes. Unlike the original Final Fantasy, players could not upgrade their characters' classes. The game is also one of the few games in the series to not use experience-based levels. Instead, each character participating in battle develops depending on what actions they take. For instance, characters who use a particular type of weapon frequently will become more adept at wielding a weapon of that type, and will also increase in physical strength and accuracy. Attributes include hit points, magic points, magic power, stamina, strength, spirit, agility, intelligence, and evasion. Players can also increase their ability to wield certain types of weapon, and repeated use in combat causes the ability to level up. Hit points (HP) and magic points (MP) increase with their use; a character who takes a heavy amount of damage in a battle might earn an increase in maximum HP, while a character who uses a lot of MP during battle might increase their maximum MP. This experience system had several unintended consequences that allowed characters to gain much more experience than intended, such as players having their characters attack each other and repeatedly cast spells, thus causing their HP and abilities to grow extensively. Final Fantasy II uses the same turn-based battle system seen in the original Final Fantasy, with battle parties consisting of up to four characters at a time. The game introduces a \"back row\" in battle, within which characters or enemies are immune to most physical attacks, but can be harmed with bows and magical attacks.",

          "description": "A random sequence of tetrominoes (sometimes called \"tetrads\" in older versions)shapes composed of four square blocks eachfall down the playing field (a rectangular vertical shaft, called the \"well\" or \"matrix\"). The objective of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the way to level 15.\n\nAll of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are able to clear triples. Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a \"tetris\". (This may vary depending on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation. For instance, in the Super Rotation System used in most recent implementations, called \"Easy Spin\" in Tetris Worlds, certain rare situations allow T, S and Z to 'snap' into tight spots and clear triples.)",

          "description": "The first of many sequels to The Legend Of Zelda. Link has just turned 16, and discovers a strange birthmark on his hand. With the help of Impa, Zelda's nursemaid, Link discovers this mark is the key to unlock a secret room where Princess Zelda lies sleeping. When young, Princess Zelda was given knowledge of the Triforce of power which was used to rule the kingdom of Hyrule, but when a magician unsuccessfully tried to find out about the Triforce from Zelda, he put her into an eternal sleep. In his grief, the prince placed Zelda in this room hoping she may wake some day. He ordered all female children in the royal household to be named Zelda from this point on, so the tragedy would not be forgotten. Now, to bring Princess Zelda back, Link must locate all the pieces of the Triforce which have been hidden throughout the land.\n\nEach piece of the Triforce is in a temple guarded by a powerful monster which must be defeated. At the same time, Ganon's underlings are still around and gaining in strength and number. It is said Ganon could be brought back to life by sprinkling the blood of the one who defeated him on the ashes (Link!). \n\nZelda II: The Adventure of Link is a hybrid action/RPG game. The gameplay alternates between a top-down view (when traveling the land) and side-scrolling perspectives (when fighting, in a temple, or town). In the top-down view, Link cannot do much except for walking: in the side-scrolling action view, however, he can fight, cast spells, collect items and talk to people. \n\nWhen Link encounters an enemy in the wilderness, or enters a location which contains enemies, he can fight them with his sword. If Link is at full health, his sword can be thrown, but when he is hurt, he can only fight in melee. Link has a shield which protects him against some of the enemies' attacks if they strike the shield. Touching an enemy or getting hit by their attacks decreases Link's health. Link can replenish his health completely by encountering a fairy in the wilderness, or by using the services of a healer in a town. \n\nLink also has a \"magic\" meter. He can cast spells (as long as he learned them first) if he has some magic left. Spells cost a various amount of magic. They have various effects: they cure Link, allow him to jump very high, shoot fireballs etc. Magic can be refilled by collecting blue and red jars sometimes left behind by enemies. \n\nWhen Link slays an enemy, it might leave behind an item, or give Link some experience. When Link gains enough experience, he gains a level, which allows him to buy weapon power/maximum magic/maximum health upgrades for his experience points, or he can decide not to buy anything and stockpile his experience points for later use. \n\nThere are some items to be found that are necessary to get past certain points in the game. The Adventure of Link features a battery backup so games can be saved without the need for passwords.",

Both titles feature updated visuals from their original NES origins and an improved translation of the story, filling in certain plot holes previously untold in other re-releases.  Both games have also been rebalanced to require less \"grinding,\" and feature gameplay fixes such as party members re-targeting a new enemy if the one they currently are targeting dies.  Players are also able to save at any point outside of combat (including dungeons) and return upon loading.\n\nAs with other Final Fantasy titles, players take on the role of a group of four heroes out to save the world. Using a vast collection of spells, weapons, and potions, players will travel across the kingdom fighting a range of evil characters and gaining experience to increase strength and magic abilities. Final Fantasy I allows players to build their party out of six possible classes, with varying spells and stats.  Final Fantasy II brings more characterization to the party members, and builds their stats exclusively by constant use in battle.\n\nBoth games get additional content in this version.  Final Fantasy I features four \"Soul of Chaos\" dungeons, unlocked during the course of the plot.  These elemental dungeons are for high-level players, and feature a collection of bosses taken from later Final Fantasy games.  Final Fantasy II features an extra storyline known as the \"Soul of Rebirth.\"  This mode is unlocked after completing the game and acts as an epilogue, featuring characters killed off in the main story.  Both games gain a Bestiary that tracks all the monsters the player has fought and their stats and weaknesses.",

          "description": "The evil Dr. Robotnik wants to conquer the world. In order to do that, he imprisons and transforms all animals into robots called 'Badniks'. This way they can build his powerful weapon, the Death Egg.  Only Sonic the Hedgehog, and his new tagalong partner, Miles 'Tails' Prower, can stop Robotnik and his army of Badniks from taking over the world. \n\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed, and the sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog.  Like the original, players run through different worlds called \"Zones\", which each have their own specific theme.  There are two Acts in nearly all of the 10 Zones, and at the end of each Zone's last Act is a machine that Robotnik controls, which you must defeat to progress.\n\nSonic and Tails can collect rings which are scattered throughout all of the levels.  As with most platformers, when the player collects 100 rings, they earn an extra life.  However, the rings also act as protection - if Sonic is hurt when he is carrying rings, they scatter everywhere and he is briefly invincible.  If he is hit again when he has no rings, he'll lose a life.\n\nIf the player reaches a continue point lamppost with 50 or more rings, they'll be able to access the Special Stage.  In this stage, you must gather a set amount of rings in a halfpipe-like stage before you reach a checkpoint.  Complete all the checkpoints and you'll earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.\n\nNew to Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the ability to play the game co-op with a friend - at any time, a player can plug in a second controller and take over the AI controlled Tails.  Tails has infinite lives and the camera remains focused on Sonic, meaning that Tails will not hinder play.  Sonic (and Tails) can now also get speed from a standing start by holding down and repeatedly pressing the jump button for a \"Spin Dash\".  This is useful when stuck near steep slopes or other areas where you need some momentum.\n\nThe game also features a 2-player versus mode.  This mode is a horizontally split-screen race through levels based on three of the zones in the single player game.",

          "description": "Dr. Robotnik's Death Egg has crash-landed on Floating Island, so called because it harnesses the power of the Chaos Emeralds to float in the air.  Robotnik needs them to repair the Death Egg, so he tells the guardian of Floating Island, Knuckles the Echidna, that Sonic and Tails are there to steal them. With Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes at every turn, will they be able to stop Robotnik in time?\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic series of games.  As with the previous games, it is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed.  The basic game remains the same - players collect rings to earn extra lives, which are also used for protection, and scatter everywhere when Sonic is hurt.  Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, then letting go of down.\n\nNew to Sonic 3 are three different types of shields - the Fire Shield (which protects you from fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water Shield (which lets you breathe underwater infinitely) and the Electric Shield (which pulls nearby rings towards you).  Sonic can use extra abilities when he has these shields by pressing jump while in the air - either a horizontal fireball dash, a vertical bubble bounce, or an electric double jump.  If Sonic has no shield active, he can activate a brief energy shield, also by pressing jump in the air.  Tails cannot use the shields' special abilities, but he can instead either fly or dog paddle (in water) for a limited time.  He can also carry Sonic with him while doing so.\n\nThere are now two types of bonus stages - one is available by collecting 50 or more rings, running past a checkpoint lamppost and then jumping into the stars (as you could in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.  This stage give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups.  In this stage, there is a giant gumball machine.  By hitting the crank, you'll spit out a bonus item that can either be rings, lives or bonus shields.  The stage is over when you fall down the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe other, more important, Special Stage can be accessed by jumping into giant rings that are hidden away in secret areas in each level.  In these stages, you must collect all the blue spheres while avoiding the red ones (which end the stage early).  Collecting all of the outer blue spheres around square or rectangle sphere formations will turn them all into rings - if you collect 50 or more in this stage, you can earn a continue.  Once you collect all the blue spheres in the stage, it clears and you earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.\n\nSonic 3 features six different Zones, which are made up of two Acts.  At the end of each Act is a boss that must be defeated to complete the stage and rescue Sonic's animal friends that Robotnik has captured to turn into Badnik robots.  The zones in Sonic 3 are approximately three times bigger than those in Sonic 2, and feature multiple, branching paths.\n\nAs with Sonic 2, there is a two-player Vs. Mode, which plays in a split-screen horizontal style.  There are special monitor pick-ups in this mode which do things like swap player positions, lose rings, or cause a Badnik to appear.  You can also race against the clock in a time trial mode.",

Agent 007 and his friend Alec Trevalyan (a.k.a. Agent 006) were sent to Soviet Union on a secret mission. But everything goes wrong, James Bond barely escapes, and his friend is presumed dead.\n\nTen years later, a mysterious organization named \"Janus\" appeared. Commanding a new satellite called \"GoldenEye\", the organizations attempts to steal money electronically from banks, deleting all evidence of transfer. It's up to our Agent 007 to venture to Soviet Union once again, and to put an end to Janus' ambitions.\n\nIn this 3D action game, you control James Bond from a first-person perspective, using a variety of weapons (from knuckles to grenade launcher) to eliminate your foes. However, many parts require you to be careful, to stay unnoticed or to snipe guards from distance, since they will react to your presence and alarm their comrades. The game is divided into missions, and in some of them you'll have to perform other tasks besides killing your enemies: disarm bombs, take pictures of important evidence, or avoid killing scientists. The game features a multiplayer mode with a variety of options, and three difficulty levels.",

In every turn, each player rolls a die and progresses on the board, which usually has branching paths. Coins are primarily earned by performing well in a minigame played at the end of each turn. On most boards, players earn stars by reaching a star space and purchasing a star for a certain amount of coins. The star space appears randomly on one of several pre-determined locations and moves every time a star is purchased, usually occupying a blue space.\nEvery Mario Party contains at least 50 to almost 110 minigames with a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which players compete individually. In 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames, players compete as two groups, cooperating to win, even though they are still competing individually in the main game. Some minigames in Mario Party are 4-player co-op, even though it doesn't say it. In most situations, winners earn ten coins each.",

Placing in each race gives a certain amount of money which increases considerably as levels progress. This money allows the player to buy faster bikes which are needed to stay competitive.

To add to the realism, all in-game characters, terrorists, hostages and Rainbow operatives, can be wounded or dispatched in just fractions of a second. Tools such as thicker body armor, automatic rifles, and grenades have little value before the player grows accustomed to the gameplay.\n\nBefore each mission is a planning stage, during which the player is given a briefing, and then chooses the operatives to be involved in the mission, their weapons, equipment and uniform/camouflage. In earlier games, the player pre-established orders and waypoints during this step. The planning stage determined elements such as the path the AI-controlled squads would follow during the mission, as well as where they will deploy devices such as flashbangs or door breaching charges.",

Invading the bodies of the living and devouring them from the inside-out, Oblivion fed on the very energy of the dead and dying. When the Primagen's Lightship was destroyed, the chain reaction it triggered as a result was so powerful that the universe as it existed was completely eradicated, and the almighty Oblivion was pushed to the very brink of destruction. For the first time, Oblivion felt pain, fear, and hate. Though totally ravaged, Oblivion survived and now desperately seeks a means to punch through the Netherscape that separates our world from the Lost Lands (a strange and primitive world where \"time has no meaning\"), and the Lost Lands from countless others. The last shreds of the pure energy source that created our world and nearly wiped out Oblivion are contained within the Light Burden, the bag that every member of the Turok lineage has carried.
